# Exponential Regression Analysis with World Bank Data

## Description
This project is a Python-based analysis that moves beyond traditional linear approaches to explore the dynamics of exponential regression applied to real-world datasets provided by The World Bank. Utilizing foundational Python libraries such as pandas for efficient data manipulation, NumPy for advanced mathematical computations, scipy.optimize for curve fitting procedures, and Matplotlib for comprehensive data visualization, this script demonstrates the application of exponential regression techniques. The focus of this analysis is to model and interpret exponential growth patterns within the dataset, thereby providing nuanced insights into various global development trends. By employing exponential regression, this project aims to identify and analyze growth phenomena and other non-linear trends that are characteristic of many economic, social, and environmental indicators. This endeavor exemplifies the use of sophisticated data science methodologies to decode and understand complex behaviors in large-scale global datasets.

## Installation
Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system. Clone this repository, then install the required libraries using pip: ``pip install numpy matplotlib pandas scipy scikit-learn``

## Usage
Run the script from your terminal or command prompt: ``python exponential_regress.py``

The script will perform exponential regression analysis on the dataset, outputting the regression coefficients, R-squared value, and generating plots to visualize the data and the regression line.
